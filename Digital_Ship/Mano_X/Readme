Welcome to Mano_X
The software is developed to compute and validate the standard procedures for ship maneuverability according to the standard IMO rules featuring the turning circle and zigzag test.
For this, the software combines the equations of motion in the three degrees of freedom surge X sway Y and yaw N based on the ship non-linear hydrodynamic coefficient. Also, taking into account the effect of shallow water on ship maneuvering capabilities is also considered.

**Instructions**
1. Download and Install Mano_X.exe 
2. Navigate and open the installed program.
3. The first step is to navigate to ship parameter tab to input ship details and hydrodynamic coefficients by clicking Custom in the ship type drop down box. 
4. User can also acces the pre-programmed datas for the three different ship models: Ferry Ship, Tanker Ship and Container Ship. The ship parameters and hydrodynamic coefficients will be automatically uploaded.
5. After input ship details and hydrodynamic coefficients, navigate to the Analysis tab.
6. Select the type of maneuver you will prefer to perfom. Turning Circle, ZigZag (10/10, 20/20) test.
7. Select the water depth. For Shallow water, type in the shallow water depth > 1 and press enter. The unit is in meters.
8. User can either input Froude number, the initial ship speed before maneuvering will be automatically calculated or input the initial ship speed. 
9. Input the time for the maneuver in the minutes field, and the time step in the Î”T field and press enter. 
10. Indicate the rudder angle in degrees and the rate of rudder change in degree/secs and press enter. 
11. Input propeller details and press enter. 
12. Use the Calculate button to compute the selected maneuvering option. 
13. User can export the result to excel sheet by first creating and saving a blank sheet. Close the sheet before clicking on generate data. 
14. Wait for 15secs for the program to write the datas and plots to the created excel sheet. 
15. User can access the excel sheet after generating the result and plot.
