The software is developed to compute and validate the standard procedures for ship maneuverability based on the ship non-linear hydrodynamic coefficient according to the standard IMO rules featuring turning circle and zigzag test.
The software combines the equations of motion in the three degrees of freedom surge X sway Y and yaw N. Also, taking into account the effect of shallow water on ship maneuvering capabilities is also considered.
